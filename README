- To execute a random walk with restart on this data using Pegasus follow
  these steps:
	1.) Make sure to have Hadoop and Pegasus installed
	2.) From the pegasus console add the desired edge file:
		ex: add /path/to/2001_file investments_2001
	3.) Make sure to add the query file to the HDFS:
		ex: hadoop fs -mkdir query_dir
		    hadoop fs -put investments2001.query query_dir
	4.) From the pegasus console do:
		compute rwr investments_2001
		parameters:
			query_path: query_dir
			#_of_nodes: see graphSizes.txt for total # of nodes
				    for the year 2001
			#_of_reducers: 1
			makesym or nosym: nosym

- To excute either a degree distribution, connected component, or radius computation follow these steps:
	- follow steps 1-3 above
	- From the pegasus console do:
		compute [deg, cc or radius] (depending which one you want to do)
